# AWS-Basic-Web-Application-Tutorial

Welcome to my tutorial on creating a basic web application hosted on AWS! In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the process of building a simple web app that initially displays "Hello World." We'll then take it a step further by adding functionality to customize the displayed text based on your input.

## What I'll Achieve

Throughout this tutorial, we'll accomplish the following tasks together:

1. **Create a web app**
2. **Connect the web app to a serverless backend**
3. **Add interactivity to the web app using an API and a database**

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account: If you don't have one yet, no worries! Follow the steps in the "Setting Up Your Environment" guide to quickly set up your AWS account.

## Application Architecture

Let's take a moment to understand the architecture of the application. The diagram below illustrates the key AWS services we'll be using: AWS Amplify, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

As we progress through this tutorial, I'll provide detailed explanations of each service and share additional resources to help you familiarize yourself with them. Get ready to embark on this journey of creating your very own AWS-hosted web application!
